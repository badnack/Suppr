# Suppr: A social as well as economically sound website that lets people connect and share the costs of a meal, whether they are strangers or friends. Food is costly and buying in bulks is often the best way to keep cost of meals low. It also leaves you with a lot of food left over and high lump sums. For those who do not want to eat leftovers for dinner every day for a month, or for those who simply want the company of others during meals, Suppr connects its participants in dinner parties where the host arranges and approves guests from their area who will all split the costs and hopefully share a great food induced experience.
